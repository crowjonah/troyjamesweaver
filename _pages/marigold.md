a thirty-something floral salesman searches for reasons to keep living.

<p class="lead">“troy james weaver writes like the angel of death is holding a smith & wesson to his head. marigold is a hundred haikus of loneliness, pages torn from baudelaire’s dream journal, the suicide note as high art. forget your dime-a-dozen writers on the new york times bestseller list; here is an authentic voice crying out from the american darkness.”<br />— kevin maloney, author of <em>cult of loretta</em></p>
