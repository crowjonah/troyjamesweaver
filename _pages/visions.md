​“Troy James Weaver’s novel unravels the typical coming-of-age story. It erases the distinction between finding and losing your voice, becoming enlightened by a vision and swallowed by darkness. The plot moves at a breathless pace and the unsettling details linger, hovering at the edge of what can be fully understood.”
—Jeff Jackson, author of _Mira Corpora_

“A noir fueled as much by the dread of what might happen as what actually occurs, with a narrator teetering on the edge of something very dark indeed. Beautifully sparse and precise, like someone tapping softly on your skull with a ball-peen hammer trying to feel out the perfect place to crack it open.”
—Brian Evenson, author of _Windeye_ and _A Collapse of Horses_

### Praise for _Temporal_

- Dennis Cooper's [Favorites of 2021](https://denniscooperblog.com/mine-for-yours-my-favorite-fiction-poetry-non-fiction-film-art-and-internet-of-2021-so-far/)

<!-- “Troy James Weaver can write an irrational divorced drunken noise rock making bathrobe clad dad like a motherfucker. And if that isn't enough to make you buy Temporal right now than there's little hope left for any of us.”

— Steve Anwyll, author of WELFARE

“Troy James Weaver guides us through a charred, hellish landscape full of dead people and clouds and broken brains. We should salute him for this intense and mysterious novel of devastation. For fans of Denis Johnson, My Bloody Valentine, and NyQuil.”

— Patty Yumi Cottrell, author of SORRY TO DISRUPT THE PEACE

“Troy James Weaver is incredible. Temporal is his best work.”

— Bud Smith, author of WORK

“Temporal is a novel painted with the blood of damaged, disaffected teenagers. Imagine S.E. Hinton if she listened to Sonic Youth. With each new book Troy James Weaver writes, he's creating more of an impressive landscape of American gloom and melancholy. But he’s also able to highlight an elusive beauty in the life struggles of his characters.”

— Kevin Sampsell, author of THIS IS BETWEEN US -->
