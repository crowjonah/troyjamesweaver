# troy's website

To edit the `writing` and `books` pages, find them in the `_pages` folder, and click the pencil icon to edit them. These pages are written in Markdown, which is a simple way to format text. Here's a [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for Markdown. After you've made your changes, find the green "Commit changes" button, and click it to save your changes. Add a brief description of the changes you made in the "Commit changes" box (e.g. `Add Paris Review piece`), and then click the green "Commit changes" button to save your changes. The website should reflect your changes within a few minutes.

## Add a new book
